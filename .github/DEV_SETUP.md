# Development Setup Complete! 🎉

This document provides a quick reference for the development tools now available in this project.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit-install

# Run all CI checks locally
make ci

# Or run individual checks
make test          # Run tests
make lint          # Run golangci-lint
make build         # Build all packages
make examples      # Build all examples
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run before each commit to catch issues early:
- `gofmt` - Format Go code
- `goimports` - Organize imports  
- `go mod tidy` - Keep go.mod clean
- `golangci-lint` - Run linter checks
- File hygiene checks (trailing whitespace, etc.)

Install: `make pre-commit-install` or `pre-commit install`

## GitHub Actions CI

The project now has automated CI that runs on every push and pull request:

### Test Job
- Runs on Go 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23
- Executes full test suite with race detector
- Generates coverage reports
- Uploads coverage to Codecov (on Go 1.23)

### Lint Job  
- Runs golangci-lint with comprehensive checks
- Uses Go 1.23
- Configuration in `.golangci.yml`

### Build Job
- Verifies all packages build
- Builds all example programs
- Ensures no build regressions

## Makefile Targets

Run `make help` to see all available targets:

```
  all                  Run all checks and build everything
  build                Build all packages
  ci                   Run all CI checks locally
  clean                Clean build artifacts and coverage files
  examples             Build all examples
  fmt                  Format code with gofmt
  help                 Display this help message
  imports              Organize imports with goimports
  lint-fix             Run golangci-lint and auto-fix issues
  lint                 Run golangci-lint
  pre-commit-install   Install pre-commit hooks
  pre-commit           Run pre-commit hooks on all files
  test-cover           Run tests with coverage
  test-race            Run tests with race detector
  test                 Run all tests
  tidy                 Run go mod tidy
  verify               Verify dependencies
```

## Known Issues

Some linter warnings are expected and will be addressed in future PRs:
- Unchecked errors in defer statements
- Some test cleanup code without error checks

These are tracked for cleanup but don't block development.

## Configuration Files

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook configuration
- `.golangci.yml` - Linter configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow
- `Makefile` - Development task automation

## Next Steps

1. Install pre-commit hooks: `make pre-commit-install`
2. Run CI checks locally before pushing: `make ci`
3. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full contribution guidelines
